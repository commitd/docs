 Committed Gatsby Theme Docs
</h1>

A Gatsby theme for documentaion sites. See http://committed.software/theme for instructions.

## Development

We use workspaces to develop the theme alongside an example usage that also serves as instructions. This is managed through yarn workspaces. See parent [README.md](../README.md) for more details.

### 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that this project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site using the theme.

3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for the Gatsby theme. This specifies which Gatsby plugins are included, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

4.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These set up the docs pages.

5.  **`LICENSE`**: licensed under the MIT license.

6.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for the projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

7.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

### 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
