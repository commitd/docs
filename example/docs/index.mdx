# @committed/gatsby-theme-docs

The gatsby theme allows you to write documentation in Markdown. With support for:

- :zap: MDX
- :camera: images
- :pencil2: svg
- :tropical_fish: mermaid diagrams
- :package: @committed/components
- :tada: :shortcode: emoji.

This is meant for Committed's documentation site, but feel free to use it, or copy it, for your own projects.
