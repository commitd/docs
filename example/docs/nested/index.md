# Nested

This file is the `index.md` in the `nested` folder. In this situation we show this page on selecting the group using the path of the folder with a trailing slash (e.g. `/nested/`). If a `title` is supplied in the frontmatter, it will override the name of the folder.

Avoid having files with the same name as a folder at the same level. They will appear in the menu but navigating to them is inconsistent due to the redirecting without the trailing slash to the folder.
