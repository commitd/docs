# Nested

This file shares the same root name `nested` as the folder.
In this situation we show this page on selecting the group and can then expand into the group to see more.

We also support the use of an `index.md(x)` file inside the folder as the root page for the folder.

In both cases, if a `title` is supplied in the frontmatter, it will override the name of the folder.
